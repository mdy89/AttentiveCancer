AttentiveCancer: an attention framework using subnetwork level representation of transcriptome for predicting lymph node metastasis in early oral cancer

# Abstract
Cervical lymph node metastasis is a major factor for poor prognosis in oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma, which occurs even in the early stages. Current clinical diagnosis depends on physical examinations that are not precise enough to determine whether a micrometastasis remains. For this reason, clinicians recommend lymphadenectomy to patients who might not need the resection. The transcriptome profiling technique has shown great potential in predicting micrometastasis by capturing the dynamic activation status of genes at the whole-genome scale. However, there are some technical challenges in using transcriptome data for modeling the patient states: 1) the insufficient number of samples compared to the number of genes, 2) the complex dependency between genes to express cancer phenotypes, and 3) the inter-patient heterogeneity between geographically and ethnically different cohorts. 

We developed a computational framework to determine metastatic potentials in early oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma. Our method consists of three novel computational techniques designed to overcome the aforementioned challenges. Our method achieved high accuracy in predicting metastatic potential across two geographically and ethnically different cohorts, TCGA and SNUH cohorts in Korea. The robustness and reproducibility shown in the evaluation results indicate that our proposed method has great potential as a diagnostic tool for lymph node metastasis in early oral cancer.
