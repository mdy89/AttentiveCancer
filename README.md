# Title
Subnetwork level representation learning framework for discovering network biomarkers in predicting lymph node metastasis in early oral cancer patients

# Abstract
Cervical lymph node metastasis is a major factor in poor prognosis for oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma, which also occurs at an early stage. The current clinical diagnosis depends on a physical examination that is not enough to determine whether micrometastasis remains. The transcriptome profiling technique has shown great potential for micrometastasis prediction by capturing the dynamic activation state of genes at the whole-genome scale. However, there are some technical challenges in using transcriptome data to model patient conditions: 1) insufficient number of samples compared to the number of genes, 2) complex dependence between genes expressing the cancer phenotype, and 3) heterogeneity between patients between geographically and ethnically different cohorts.

We developed a computational framework to discover network biomarkers and determine metastatic potential in early oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma. Our method consists of three new computational techniques designed to overcome the problems mentioned above. Our method achieved high accuracy in predicting the metastatic potential in two geographically and racially different groups, TCGA and SNUH in Korea. The robustness of the predictive model and the reproducibility of the discovered network biomarkers presented in the evaluation results indicate that the proposed method has great potential as a diagnostic tool for lymph node metastasis in early oral cancer.
